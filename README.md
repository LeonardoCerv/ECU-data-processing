## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive temperature data processing system using the MARIE (Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy) simulator. The system analyzes 30 temperature readings from a vehicular sensor, collected at 10-second intervals, performing statistical analysis and unit conversions entirely in assembly language.

**Key Features:**
- Identification of minimum and maximum temperature values with timestamps
- Median calculation using custom sorting algorithms
- Temperature conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Real-time data processing simulation for automotive ECU applications

## Technical Implementation

The following algorithms were implemented in MARIE assembly language, following the logical flow depicted in the system diagram:

### Core Algorithms Implemented

**1. Min/Max Detection with Index Tracking**
- Linear scan algorithm to identify extreme values
- Concurrent index tracking to determine timestamps (converted to seconds)
- Memory-efficient pointer-based array traversal

**2. Bubble Sort Implementation**

The implementation follows this structured approach:

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifies minimum/maximum values and their occurrence times
2. **Data Sorting**: Implements bubble sort for median preparation  
3. **Median Calculation**: Determines the middle value of the sorted dataset
4. **Unit Conversion**: Converts all temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit

Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive data processing pipeline that mirrors the complexity of real automotive ECU operations.

## Final Reflection

The most significant challenge was translating high-level algorithmic concepts into MARIE's primitive instruction set. Implementing bubble sort required creative flag management and meticulous memory trackingâ€”constraints that fundamentally changed how I approach problem decomposition.

This project bridged theoretical computer science with automotive engineering reality. Working at the machine level revealed how ECU operations that seem instantaneous actually require careful orchestration of basic computational steps. The experience highlighted that modern software abstraction layers, while convenient, can obscure the resource optimization skills essential for embedded systems.

The discipline of assembly programming has permanently sharpened my approach to software efficiency, preparing me for embedded systems and real-time processing challenges where every instruction matters.
